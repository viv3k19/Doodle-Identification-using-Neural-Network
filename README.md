# Doodle-Identification-using-Neural-Network
The project aims to train a model to recognize doodles, digits, and predict CIFAR-10 images using the backpropagation algorithm. The datasets used for this purpose are Quick Draw, MNIST, and CIFAR-10. Additionally, the model is computed with weights, biases, and the gradient descent algorithm, with the activation function used - sigmoid function.
